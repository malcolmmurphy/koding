Still have yet to complete this page, sorry... Going to sleep now but please check back soon, I should have a detailed update by this time tomorrow. Thank you!

Quick note in the meantime... I wasn't sure if this repo was supposed to contain the entire app or just our work. I used CakePHP so there's a mix of default files in here (but not the full Cake library). Primarily my work is in:

Basic controller:

    Controller/AppController.php

Prediction/Estimate algorithms:

    Model/Temperature.php
    Model/SeaLevel.php
    Model/Co2.php
    Console/Command/SandboxShell.php

View:

    View/app/index.ctp
    webroot/js/main.js
    webroot/css/main.css

Cheers.
