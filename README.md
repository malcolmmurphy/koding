Koding Hackathon Submission
======

(will complete once I get some sleep and catch up on work)

One quick note on the off chance that this is viewed in the meantime... I wasn't sure if this repo was supposed to contain the entire app or just our work. I used CakePHP so there's a mix of default files in here (but not the full Cake library). Primarily my work is in:

    Controller/AppController.php
    Model/Temperature.php
    Model/SeaLevel.php
    Model/Co2.php
    View/app/index.ctp
    webroot/js/main.js
    webroot/css/main.css
    
Cheers.
